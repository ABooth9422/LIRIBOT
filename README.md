# LIRIBOT
LIRI BOT

The point of the LIRI BOT is to execute a series of AXIOS calls to different API based on user input.

We are going to be using npm for the axios, spotify, omdb, and bands in town.

We are also going to process the result and format it a way that can be easily recognized in the terminal.

The goal of the project is to have a firm understanding of node.js and the power that it can provide on the back end.
